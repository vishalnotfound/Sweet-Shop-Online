This project used AI responsibly to enhance development workflow :

ChatGPT: Helped in brainstorming API structure and generating initial boilerplate code.

GitHub Copilot: Assisted in writing repetitive unit tests and frontend component scaffolding.

Reflection: AI helped speed up repetitive coding tasks while I focused on logic, design, and testing. All AI-generated code was reviewed, modified, and fully understood before committing.
